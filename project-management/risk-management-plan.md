## Risk Monitoring and Control

### Weekly Risk Review
- Review status of all identified risks
- Update probability and impact assessments
- Evaluate effectiveness of mitigation strategies
- Identify new risks

### Risk Reporting
- Include risk status in weekly project reports
- Highlight any risks that have changed status
- Document any risk events that occurred
- Update mitigation and contingency plans as needed

### Risk Triggers
- Define specific conditions that indicate a risk is about to occur
- Establish monitoring mechanisms for each trigger
- Create alert system for when triggers are activated

## Risk Response Process

1. **Risk Identification**: Any team member can identify a new risk
2. **Risk Assessment**: Project Manager evaluates probability and impact
3. **Risk Response Planning**: Develop mitigation and contingency plans
4. **Risk Assignment**: Assign risk owner responsible for monitoring and response
5. **Risk Monitoring**: Regular tracking of risk indicators
6. **Risk Response**: Implement mitigation or contingency plans when needed
7. **Risk Closure**: Document resolution and lessons learned
